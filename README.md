A basic grid is defined by giving a container grid class and children the col class. Children of the grid will have the same width and scale according to the width of the parent.

Breakpoints define how the display property should be defined depending on the screen size. Design is mobile first so smaller values can also apply to larger values e.g. md also applies to lg or xl if they are not explicitly defined.

sm: small screens e.g. phones
md: medium screens e.g. tablets
lg: large screens e.g. notebooks
xl: larger screens .e.g monitors
